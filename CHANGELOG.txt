Changes in version 1.1
------------------------

* Allow alternative templates to be specified on the command line, rather than
  requiring them to be added to the classpath.

* Renamed style.css to zeitgeist.css.

* Improved image detection in feeds, now recognises entity-encoded img tags.

* Download and cache thumbnail images and favicons rather than linking to
  originals.

* Improved favicon detection (home page is now downloaded and scanned for link
  tags when there is no favicon.ico in the web root).

* Added expiry meta tag to default templates.
